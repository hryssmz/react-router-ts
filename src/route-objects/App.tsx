      <h1>Route Objects Example</h1>

      <p>
        This example demonstrates how to use React Router's "route object" API
        instead of the JSX API to configure your routes. Both APIs are
        first-class. In fact, React Router actually uses the object-based API
        internally by creating route objects from your{" "}
        <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>
        elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        React Router exposes a <code>useRoutes()</code> hook that allows you to
        hook into the same matching algorithm that <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>{" "}
        uses internally to decide which <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> to render.
        When you use this hook, you get back an element that will render your
        entire route hierarchy.
